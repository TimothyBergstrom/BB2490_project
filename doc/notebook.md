# Diary Timothy Bergström Course BB2490

### 2018-11-27, 18:00

First entry and creation of project diary. My idea is to have it in github,
since it will be easy to follow any commits and timeline of project.

### 2018-11-29, 13:30

First meeting, and we created the project plan. Our plan is to first familiarize ourselfs with the programs, then try to recreate two plots with the data from the paper.


### 2018-12-01, 16:00

I got a license for MaxQuant and installed it on my computer and installed it.
I'm about to install quandenser, and my idea is to make an ssh server which the other in my group can log into.


### 2018-12-01,16:30

I've been struggling with installing Quandenser. The command "git clone --recursive https://github.com/statisticalbiotechnology/quandenser.git" seems to breaks when try it.
Sometimes it says "Public key" is denied and other times that "Connection error". I tested on multiple networks, so I cant be that.


### 2018-12-01, 16:45

It seems to be something strange when cloning the other modules. No matter, I manually cloned each one with "git clone <LINK_TO_REPO>".
It seems to install now, but it crashes when fixing boost.


### 2018-12-02, 13:00

I cant make it install. It seems to not be able to find the library files. I tried to include "-BOOST_LIBRARY_DIR=$build_dir/tools/lib" in "admin/builders/ubuntu64_build.sh" but it does not work.
I'll send an email to Lukas tomorrow if I can't get it to work.


### 2018-12-02, 13:40

I went into "ubuntu64_build.sh" and enabled "-DBoost_DEBUG=1" in the cmake line. The output seems to crash when trying to import the "boost.atomic" library file.
I'm currently downloading "boost" independently with the command "sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev". 


### 2018-12-02, 13:50

I deleted the "build" folder which is installed when running ./quickbuild.sh and am currently rerunning the script.
This might take some time before I see the results, hopefully it works now.


### 2018-12-02, 14:10

Well, the error with the boost is gone, but now theres something else crashing...
The error was "Cannot create module Dinosaur, mvn execution failed"


### 2018-12-02, 14:30

Percolator and maracluster compiles fine
Something is crashing on this line in CMakeLists:

"execute_process(COMMAND mvn package -Pconf -DskipTests -Ddir=${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/dinosaur WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/ext/dinosaur RESULT_VARIABLE MVN_RESULT)"

The "mvn" is a java tool. I thought I already installed java with "apt-get install default-jdk" with version openjdk 10.0.2, but Ill reinstall it and see what happens.


### 2018-12-02, 14:50

Reinstalling java did not work, but installing maven with "sudo apt install maven" made it run. However it crashed once again...

"Failed to execute goal org.scala-tools:maven-scala-plugin:2.15.2:compile (default) on project Dinosaur: wrap: org.apache.commons.exec.ExecuteException: Process exited with an error: 1(Exit value: 1) -> [Help 1]"

using mvn -X to get full debug, it seems that some dependencies are missing.


### 2018-12-02, 15:00

Okay, default-jdk is "openjdk" which is not the same as oracles own like I thought it was. Installing oracles java after purging openjdk makes dinosaur compile. However, there is another error, once again...

maracluster/CMakeFiles/maracluster.dir/build.make:113: recipe for target 'maracluster/maracluster' failed

[ 29%] Linking CXX executable maracluster crashes here

Apperently maracluster fails due to "unreferenced" dependencies in some compiled functions. Perhaps the other boost libraries are making the crashes?


### 2018-12-02, 20:40

I just can't get it to work. I've tried a lot of stuff, purging the old boost files and trying to make FindBoost find the static libraries, but to no avail.


### 2018-12-03, 14:20

I got it to work with the help of Lukas Käll and Patrick Truong. Instead of compiling everything from scratch, I forgot to look at the "releases" folder where the .deb files are stored. My fault.

I also found what the problem was with both the compilation and the --recursive issues. The problem was intranet-issues + antivirus. I tried to install on both my laptop and my desktop on 2 networks, my home router and using my phone as a hotspot by sharing the 4g connection.
I had added a ssh-key to my account beforehand for both laptop and desktop, so it was not that problem.

The AV blocked some packages from downloading (for some reason) making the dependencies fail. I deactivated my AV beforehand to test whether that was the problem after a fresh Ubuntu installation and the packages installed correctly.
The intranet blocked incoming traffic from port 22 for some reason, even though I had the port-forwarded to my computer. I tried to force the ssh to use port 443 instead in the /etc/ssh/ssh_config, but with the same issues.
The phone did it as well, but later found out that using ssh from a hotspot does not work. https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/120819/ssh-tunnel-through-android-device

So this means that neither networks worked.

However, I went to school and tested it on the network there. Now, downloading the repos recursively works fine (since there is no block when using the intranet in school). The AV does not block any packages, since it is deactivated.
However, the problem with Boost libraries persist. It still says:

CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-3.10/Modules/FindBoost.cmake:1947 (message):
  Unable to find the requested Boost libraries.

  Boost version: 1.56.0

  Boost include path:
  /mnt/c/Users/timot/Downloads/BB2490/build/ubuntu64/tools/include

  Could not find the following static Boost libraries:

          boost_filesystem
          boost_iostreams
          boost_regex
          boost_thread
          boost_serialization
          boost_system
          boost_chrono

  Some (but not all) of the required Boost libraries were found.  You may
  need to install these additional Boost libraries.  Alternatively, set
  BOOST_LIBRARYDIR to the directory containing Boost libraries or BOOST_ROOT
  to the location of Boost.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  ext/maracluster/src/CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package)
  
  
However, the .deb file works, so it doesn't matter at the moment.


### 2018-12-03, 15:10

I really wanted to see what the problem was with the libraries, so I continued to debug it.
I found why the boost libraries does not compile. It was pretty simple:
I had gcc installed from before (I have a course in C programming) and I tested on a non-fresh install of ubuntu, 
so FindBoost detects that I have gcc7 installed, thus it looks for files named:

"libboost_filesystem-gcc7-mt-s.a"

while the lib files are called 

"libboost_filesystem-gcc-mt-s.a".

The output of the terminal when gcc have not been renamed has been added to "terminal_output" folder with the name "gcc_problem.txt"

Adding "7" to all filenames with gcc in them made it work. I successfully compiled the .deb file (which was already found in the release folder)
Maybe I'll test it on a fresh install of ubuntu to see if the problem persist, maybe it was just a collision between already installed gcc.
